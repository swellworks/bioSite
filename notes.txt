XX Just this once, Google examples of jpg, png and gif images and save the three images to a folder called “images” in your EX4 folder. No animated gifs please. Hint: for the gif, look for a logo.

XX Add the three images below the link you added last week, but above the “back to top” link.

XX Use one figure tag around all three images and add figure captions to each image. Be creative. Also, make sure your images all have alt info.

XX Make all the images the same width. Don’t stretch them horizontally or vertically.

Use the Oswald font stack with a weight of 400 and size from your scale for the captions.

XX Color palette:

Color Palette

XX Using rgba, add the second color in the palette (247, 112, 34) color to the background of the entire page. Make the opacity of the background 20 percent.

XX Using rgba, add the fourth color (185, 63, 8) to the h1 and h2 tags.

XX Apply 100% of the background color to the sentence class.

XX Fill the Top Ten box with a color from the palette and reverse the type color to white using hex color shorthand.

XX Remove the red border color from the Top Ten box and change the red border color to a color from the palette for the Five Things box.
