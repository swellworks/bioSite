        <div style="flex-grow: 1"><p><span class="intro-word">Time to learn a bit more about this man.</span> Let me introduce a super old friend, Mark Wolford. I've know this person from the wee age of 4 years old. Although at some points in our life we have moved away from each other, but when it comes right down to it we've been friends forever. And it feels like that sometimes.</p>

He really never quite fit in. His sense of humor was the only thing that kept him from being pulverized by bullies. He & I somewhat distanced ourselves from each other - he got way into music & I got into chasing girls. High school days we were kind of on & off friends, but always hung out at particular times.</p>

He tried super hard to be in a cover band with one of his older brothers - the band was gearing up to start playing on cruise ships. Alas, that wasn't in the cards... he soon moved home for a bit & started community college & this is where we really started to bond. I had my own acoustic jam night & he wanted to join in on the drums & I said of course! We had a rough go of it & he decided to go to Iowa for college - that also didn't last long, as we had really began to get the band working on regular gigs around Omaha.</p>
