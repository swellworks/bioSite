Some suggest that 5G networks cause radiation, which, in turn, triggers the virus. There are, it turns out, many 5G coronavirus theories, and no simple hierarchy of plausibility. Some adherents have adopted the notion that the 5G frequency spectrum somehow transmits and spreads the virus, as if in a wireless miasma.</p>

        <div style="flex-grow: 1"><p><img src="images/mw-weird-beard-sized.jpg" class="flex-img-right-2 res-img"><span class="intro-word">Tartarians:</span> We talked for quite a while about this one. I still am not sure what to think - he keeps explaining that this civilization was wiped off the face of the earth or something & that it isn't in any history books. And I'm to blinded by the lamestream media to get it. The official history is hiding a major world power which existed as late as the 19th century. Tartary was a country with its own flag, its own government and its own place on the map. Its territory was huge, but somehow quietly incorporated into Russia, and some other countries. This country you can find on the maps predating the second half of the 19th century.</p>

Mark was trying to explain to me - that technologically viable, pollution-free, no-cost energy sources are being suppressed by government, corporations, or advocacy groups. The claim that devices exist which are capable of extracting significant and usable power from pre-existing unconventional energy reservoirs, such as the quantum vacuum zero point energy, for little or no cost, but are being suppressed.[</p>
